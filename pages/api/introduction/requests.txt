Making Requests
===============

### RESTish Design ###
The SnapBill API is designed using **REST** principles (some, but not all.) The API runs over HTTP, and is located at [https://api.snapbill.com/v1](https://api.snapbill.com/v1)

You can access the entire API using only **GET** and **POST** requests. The reason for this is to maintain [browsability](#browse-able) but it also serves to simplify certain actions and the design.

<section id="get">
### GET *(Discoverability)* ###

**GET** requests form the discoverable layer of the API. They can be used to retrieve indexes and example forms with controls.

    $ curl -u user:pass \
    >      https://api.snapbill.com/v1/client.json
</pre><pre class="output">
%%json:examples/requests.txt-1.json%
</pre></pre>

<pre><pre class="input">
    $ curl -u user:pass \
    >      https://api.snapbill.com/v1/client/add.json
</pre><pre class="output">
%%json:examples/requests.txt-2.json%
</pre></pre>

</section>

<section id="post">
### POST *(Actions)* ###

All standard requests to the API will be **POST** requests. These are used to add new clients (**POST /v1/client/add**), to list existing invoices (**POST /v1/invoice/list**) and to update (**POST /v1/service/{id}/update**) or delete (**POST /v1/charge/{id}/delete**).
