API Reference: User
=======================

<section id="description" markdown=1>
User objects allow clients to login to the client area (https://*&lt;your username&gt;*.snapbill.com).
</section>

<section class="api-call" id="add-user" data-title="/add_user" markdown=1>
### /v1/client/*id*/add_user ###

<!-- eval: client_id = self.fetch_single('client', 'id') -->

This api call will create a user. Since we have not specified the username and password they will be automatically generated.

**Note** The password is returned here, but will not be available in future requests.
