#### Add Recurring Invoice Parameters ####

%parameter-table
first: add
    The first date the recurring invoice is to run on

last: add
    An optional date after which the recurring invoice should not go off.

mode: add
    The mode of recurring invoice. This can either be **ONCEOFF** (only once), **DAYWEEK** (specific day of each week), **DAYMONTH** (specific day of each month), or **WEEKDAYMONTH** (specific weekday of each month). Each of these are explained in detail below.

weekday: add
    Field required if mode is **DAYWEEK** or **WEEKDAYMONTH**. 0 through 6 (Sunday=0, Monday=1, ... Sunday=6).

number: add
    For **DAYMONTH** this is the day number (6 = 6th), or the week number for **WEEKDAYMONTH** (2 = 2nd week)

interval: add
    This is the interval between each recurring invoice. Default value is 1, setting it to 12 on **DAYMONTH** will send invoices once a year.

description[]: add
    A description for an invoice item

unit_cost[]: add
    The cost for a unit of an invoice item

quantity[]: add
    The amount of units of an invoice item
    
%%%

The invoice items can be repeated (description, unit_cost, quantity). The
first description matches up with the first unit_cost and quantity. Similarly
for the 2nd description, etc.

### Recurring Modes ###


#### ONCEOFF ####

The recurring invoice will run once, and only once.

#### DAYWEEK ####

This recurring mode can be used to invoice once a week. The **weekday** field specifies which day of the week (Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Sunday=6). The **interval** field specifies the number of weeks between charges (i.e. a **interval**=2 value will charge the invoice every second week.)

#### DAYMONTH ####

This mode can be used to invoice clients every number of months. The **number** field indicates the day of the month to charge. A **number**=6 value will charge on the 6th day of each month. Number can also be negative in which case it is counted from the end of the month (**number**=-1 will charge on the last day of each month). The **interval** field specifies the number of months between charges (i.e. a **interval**=6 value will charge the invoice every six months.)

#### WEEKDAYMONTH ####

The recurring invoice will run on a specified weekday each month. This is useful for invoicing on the first Monday, or the last Friday. The **weekday** field (similar to DAYWEEK mode) specifies which weekday to charge on, while the **number** field specifies which week to charge. Interval indicates the number of months between charges. For example **weekday**=2,**number**=1,**interval**=12 will run on the first Tuesday once a yearg
