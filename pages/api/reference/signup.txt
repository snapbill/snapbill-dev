### Creating signups ###

The ability to create signups that at a certain step of the process is a very powerful tool of the api. We do allow you 
to jump straight to certain points which is fully described by our [Signup forms](/home/signup/signup) article.

Instead of passing all the information through on a GET request, or if you want to link to a signup for a client logged in we do have API requests that will create the signup.

<section class="api-call" id="add-client-signup" data-title="/client/add_signup" markdown=1>
### /v1/client/*id*/add_signup ###

<!-- eval: client_id = self.fetch_single('client', 'id') -->

This api call will create a signup. Once created just redirect the client to url.signup that is returned by the call. This example automatically selects a service type, package and term for the client.


<pre><pre class="input">
    $ curl -u user:pass -d 'options={"service_type":"Sample Service","service-package":"Small","service-term":1}'
    >      https://api.snapbill.com/v1/client/<!-- client_id -->117559/add_signup.json
</pre><pre class="output">
%%json:examples/signup.txt-1.json%

This api creates a signup for an invoice. Full details about invoice signups are available in our [Signup forms](/home/signup/signup) article.
