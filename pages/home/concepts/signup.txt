Signup
===========

<section id="signup" markdown=1>
The standard signup form allows a client to sign up for a single service. We do intend to add other types of signups, perhaps single page and shopping cart versions, at a later stage but for now only the single service version is available and default.

### Skipping steps ###
You can skip the "Are you a new or existing customer?" step simply by including a <code>?**customer=new**</code> value at the end of your signup url. If you want to skip any other steps you can simply provide values for every field on the page. If you leave out any fields whatsoever, the fields provided are simply used as default values during the signup.

As an example, to skip the client form as well you can use ([example](https://franks.snapbill.com/signup?customer=new&client-title=Mr&client-firstname=Website&client-surname=Example&client-email=website@example.com&client-cell=&client-company=&client-data-vat_number=)):

<pre>
https://&lt;your-username&gt;.snapbill.com/signup?customer=new
  &client-title=<strong>Mr</strong>&client-firstname=<strong>Website</strong>&client-surname=<strong>Example</strong>
  &client-email=<strong>website@example.com</strong>&client-cell=&client-company=
  &client-data-custom_field=
</pre>

If you wanted to you could even skip straight to the payment step ([example](https://franks.snapbill.com/signup?customer=new&client-title=Mr&client-firstname=Website&client-surname=Example&client-email=website@example.com&client-cell=&client-company=&client-data-vat_number=&service_type=Sample+Service&service-package=Small&service-term=1)):
<pre>
https://&lt;your-username&gt;.snapbill.com/signup?customer=new
  &client-title=<strong>Mr</strong>&client-firstname=<strong>Website</strong>&client-surname=<strong>Example</strong>
  &client-email=<strong>website@example.com</strong>&client-cell=&client-company=
  &client-data-custom_field=
  &service_type=<strong>Sample+Service</strong>
  &service-package=<strong>Small</strong>&service-term=<strong>1</strong>
</pre>

An example with default values for a few client details would look like ([example](https://franks.snapbill.com/signup?customer=new&client-firstname=Website&client-surname=Example&client-email=website@example.com)):
<pre>
https://&lt;your-username&gt;.snapbill.com/signup?customer=new
  &client-firstname=<strong>Website</strong>&client-surname=<strong>Example</strong>
  &client-email=<strong>website@example.com</strong>
</pre>

**Note** that any custom fields you add will need to be included. Custom field added to the client take the form client-data-*field_name*, while custom fields on the service are similarly service-data-*field_name*.
