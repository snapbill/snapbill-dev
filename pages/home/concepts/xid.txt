XID
===

<section id="xid" markdown=1>
SnapBill always maintains two references to every object on your account. The 
objects id field will always be unique for an account.

Due to our systems design we do not guarentee that the **id** field will be
unique **across** accounts. For example if you signup to SnapBill twice, and add
clients to each account - occasionally a client on the one account will land 
up with the same *id* as a client on the other.

If you are storing data on multiple accounts we recommend either grouping your
data by account, or simply using the **xid** parameter which is guarenteed to
be unique across every single SnapBill account.
