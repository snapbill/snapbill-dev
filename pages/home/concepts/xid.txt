XID
===

<section id="xid" markdown=1>
When dealing with single accounts you can simply reference objects by their
'id', however SnapBill does not promise that id's will be unique between
different accounts. In order to reference objects uniquely we use an Xid,
which is comprised of the account and object id's.
