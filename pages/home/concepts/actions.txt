Actions
=======

<section id="actions" markdown=1>
Every change to your account on SnapBill is automatically recorded and stored as
an **action** on your account. The actions contain a full audit log and will allow
you to see exactly when each change was made, and who made the change.

For a listing of all the parameters included with actions, please check out the
[action object](/api/reference/action) under our API reference.
