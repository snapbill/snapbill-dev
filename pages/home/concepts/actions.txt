Actions
=======

Every event on SnapBill is automatically audited and stored as an "action" on
SnapBill. You can use these to check for changes on clients with our
[/action/list](/api/commands/action-list) api call, or alternatively set up a
[webhook](/api/webhooks) and we'll send a HTTP request your way every time
something happens.
