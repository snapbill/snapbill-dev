<p>Every event on SnapBill is automatically audited and stored as an "action" on SnapBill. You can use these to check for changes on clients with our <a href="/api/commands/action-list">/action/list</a> api call, or alternatively set up a <a href="/api/webhooks">webhook</a> and we'll send a HTTP request your way every time something happens.</p>
