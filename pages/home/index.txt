### Signups and Payments ####
We have a flexible signup system that lets you jumpstart a
signup for one of your clients by providing the required details
when redirecting. We also can redirect back to your site once your
client has paid.

The [Signup page](/home/signup/signup) has details.

### API reference ####
It is possible to simply open our API in your browser... once you've signed up
just go to [https://api.snapbill.com](https://api.snapbill.com). We're also
working on a detailed reference for the entire api. Check our 

[Client documentation](/api/reference/client) for an example.
