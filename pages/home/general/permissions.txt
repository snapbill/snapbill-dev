Permissions

System design
-------------

The SnapBill permission system runs according to a
[longest prefix match](#longest-prefix) based system on top of the URL 
structure that we use in SnapBill.

By default all new users simply have the **/** permission enabled which gives 
them access to everything. If you choose to **DENY /client** (access to a single
client) it will also block off the ability to add a client **/client/add**. A rule
such as **DENY /**; **ALLOW /client/add** will block the user from doing anything 
except adding new clients.

Whether we allow or deny a given address to one of your users, depends on the action
of the longest matching rule that you have defined.

Allowing **/client/\*** will allow anything under **/client** excluding **/client** itself. 
See the examples section for use cases of this.
