### Example ###

Say the payment URL for a client is
<code>**https://demo.snapbill.com/payment/client/FoE:A/GIQ56fGwX05z**</code>. After
adding an invoice for the client through the API, you can redirect them to
https://demo.com/success/FoE:A by sending the client to
<code>**https://demo.snapbill.com/payment/client/FoE:A/GIQ56fGwX05z?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo.com%2Fsuccess%2FFoE%3AA**</code>.

An example of the variables POSTed to the redirect URL is below:

<pre>
    [payment_amount] => 476
    [payment_id] => 30
    [payment_method_code] => payfast
    [payment_state] => pending
    [redirect] => https://demo.com/success/FoE:A
    [success-heading] => Your payment has been processed
    [success-message] => Your payment is marked as pending. We are still awaiting confirmation from PayFast, but as soon as that is received your invoices will be marked as paid.
    [transaction_uuid] => OWI0ZWU3ZTktYTNkYi00NGYyLWEzZWEtZWZhOWVmMzRlZGQx
    [signature] => yynYkjNvYyrMnS1wmItMa5pZhyEjtirgRM1UZ6fN6a0=
</pre>

In the case of a payment method which requires you to process the payment, the
variables passed back won't include the payment:
<pre>
    [payment_method_code] => other
    [redirect] => https://demo.com/success/FoE:A
    [success-heading] => Your payment details have been updated
    [success-message] => Thank you for updating your payment details
    [transaction_uuid] => MTA1OGRhNTItMTZlYi00YWI1LWFiMjgtNjJlMTU0N2Y3Yjc1
    [signature] => dUOawxjoHyzg9xq9t2ZCcaspIbkEVpqPKKJnqkkdTWY=
</pre>
